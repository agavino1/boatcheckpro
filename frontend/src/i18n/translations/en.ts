    questions: [
      { q: 'Do I need to be present during the inspection?', a: "Not necessarily, though many clients prefer to be there. If you can't make it, just arrange access and we'll keep you updated with real-time photos throughout." },
      { q: "I'm about to buy a used boat. Should I inspect before or after signing?", a: 'Always before signing and paying. A pre-purchase inspection lets you negotiate the price if issues are found — or avoid a costly mistake altogether. It\'s the best investment you can make in a boat purchase.' },
      { q: 'How far in advance do I need to book?', a: "The sooner the better — our schedule fills up, especially in peak season. You can book with as little as 24-48 hours' notice if there's availability, but we recommend at least a week ahead." },
      { q: 'Does the report include photos?', a: 'Yes, dozens of high-resolution photos of every inspected area: hull, engine, deck, interior, electrical systems... Everything is documented visually so there\'s no room for doubt.' },
      { q: "What's the difference between you and the marina mechanic?", a: "The marina mechanic works for the marina, not for you. We're fully independent: no conflicts of interest, no relationship with the seller, no incentive to hide problems. Our only goal is to give you an honest picture of the boat's condition." },
      { q: 'Where do you operate? Do you come to where the boat is?', a: "Yes, the technician travels to the boat's location. We operate in major ports and marinas across Europe. Just provide the location when booking and we'll confirm availability." },
      { q: 'How long does a typical inspection take?', a: "Most inspections take between 3-6 hours depending on the vessel size and complexity. We'll let you know if it runs longer." },
      { q: 'Are your technicians certified?', a: 'Yes, all our inspectors are ABYC certified with a minimum of 10 years of professional marine experience.' },
      { q: 'What if I need an underwater inspection?', a: 'We offer specialized underwater surveys with certified SCUBA divers. Available through our Expert Inspection plan.' },
      { q: 'Can I use the report for insurance?', a: 'Absolutely. Our reports are accepted by all major marine insurance companies across Europe.' },
      { q: 'What if serious issues are found?', a: "Better to know before you buy or sell. We give you a detailed report with the severity of each issue and an estimate of what it would cost to fix. That's negotiating power." },
      { q: 'Can I reschedule or cancel?', a: 'Yes, you can reschedule or cancel up to 48 hours before your appointment for a full refund, no questions asked.' },
      { q: 'Do you offer fleet inspections?', a: 'Yes, with special rates for fleets of 3 or more vessels. Get in touch and we\'ll put together a custom quote.' },
      { q: 'How long is the report valid?', a: 'Typically 6-12 months, depending on your insurance provider or financing requirements.' },
